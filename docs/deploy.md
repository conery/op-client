# Deploying a Client

## Local

Similar to Jupyter

Install using Pip

Start from command line.  App opens web browser that communicates with remote server.

Picture.

## Local Container

Similar to first approach, but if Docker installed, requires no new software.

## Container in the Cloud

More work for admin to set it up, but then users/customers connect to remote container, have to do nothing.
